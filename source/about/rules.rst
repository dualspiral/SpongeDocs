Forum & IRC Rules
=================

Welcome to the Sponge Project! We're glad you're here and interested in Sponge. We have a few rules that apply to all
of our various methods of communications, known as "Sponge systems" which are either owned, operated and/or managed
by the Sponge project. These include (but are not limited to):

* Official IRC channels: #sponge, #spongedev, #spongedocs
* Sponge Forums
* GitHub and Bug/Issue tracker
* Sponge Discord
* Sponge subreddit
* Sponge TeamSpeak Server
* Any other official means of communication by the Sponge project.

The Sponge project adheres primarily to Wheaton's Law: "Don't be a dick." We expect everyone using our communication
systems to act like a reasonable and responsible person, showing respect for other users and staff.

All users should also read our :doc:`tos` and follow the requirements it sets out.

Read on for some more specific guidance, but please remember these rules are meant to be general, not a comprehensive
list of do's and don'ts. This stuff should all be common sense.

.. note::

    Any of these rules are subject to change at any time without warning. Any content found to be in violation of
    these rules, even if the content was created before a rule was in place, may be removed by moderator approval. These
    rules apply generally to all Sponge methods of communication, but each individual sub method (eg: subreddit or Forum
    category) may have its own set of additional rules and guidelines to add on top of these general rules. If this is
    the case, both sets of rules must be followed. Rules and guidelines evolve as the Sponge community evolves. Use only
    as directed; excessive use of FLARD may rot your socks.

* Follow Support Guidelines (when they exist) for any issues you may have.

* Don't abuse the channel (IRC, Forum, Discord, etc). This means don't spam, multipost, crosspost, or flood it. Be nice and
  remember that we're all sharing the same virtual space.

* Try to keep the language at least PG-13. We're not your nanny and we're not going to give you grief over the odd curse
  word, but keep it within the bounds of reason and courtesy.

* Racism, sexism, bigotry, or hateful language is forbidden. Don't even try it. This is a strict rule - don't break it.

* Be nice to the operators and admins. They are *volunteers*, and their time is frequently limited. While they are very
  often happy to talk with you, please don't overdo private messages, pinging ops in IRC, and so forth.

* Only private message ops/mods if something needs to be kept private, they are not your personal search engine.

* Please avoid discussions of politics, religion and similar controversial topics. Not only is it not relevant to Sponge,
  it tends to create conflict where there doesn’t need to be any.

* Don't bash other projects, Mojang, or people associated with them.

* Don’t ask when Sponge will be ready. It’ll be done when it’s done. When it’s done, don’t ask for updates. They come
  out when they come out. This is a general rule for all open source projects.

* Advertising in any form is prohibited on any Sponge system. This includes but is not limited to advertising your
  favorite server hosting company, the server you play on, some piece of software you use for fun, another game, or
  whatever. Some exceptions are made in *Off-Topic* sections and are solely at the discretion of moderation staff.

* Do not attempt to make a sale or sell anything on Sponge systems. This includes, but is not limited to, plugins
  (mods or any variation of the term), art assets, services, or any work to be provided. There are exceptions for
  posts in our **Services Exchange** section for our forums, which are detailed in the :ref:`rules-services-exchange`
  section below.

* If it comes to our attention that a "lite" version plugin hosted by Sponge is being used as a promotion as a for-sale
  "premium" version, we reserve the right to remove the plugin listing. What constitutes a "lite" or "premium" version
  will be decided at the discretion of Sponge Staff.

* Please don't include *Sponge* in your plugin name. We reserve the use of *Sponge* for official SpongePowered works.
  There are two exceptions: You may append "for Sponge" to the title if your plugin also has versions for other APIs,
  and you may use *Sponge* in the title if your plugin primarily concerns the Minecraft block "Sponge".

* We aim to comply entirely with the Mojang EULA, to that end any plugins, services, posts and/or links suspected of
  violating the EULA may be removed at the discretion of the Sponge Staff or at the request of Mojang AB.

* Don’t spread rumors or falsehoods about the Sponge projects, staff members, affiliates or partners of Sponge, or any
  other defamatory statements that might harm the project.

* If you're banned or suspended, it is for a reason. Don't evade or attempt to get around bans.

* The moderator, administrator or manager(s) of the various communication channels in use by the Sponge project shall
  have the last word in any dispute.

Services Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

  The **Services Exchange** is for the advertisement of requests and offers of services, both paid and voluntary,
  related to Minecraft or Sponge. Transactions between users must be done in private and not as replies to any posts
  within the Exchange.

  **Any agreed deal is at your own risk; the Sponge project takes no responsibility for third-party transactions.**
  We cannot arbitrate on any transaction that is made as a result of an advertisement on the forums.

The **Services Exchange** section on the forums allow for limited **advertising** for providing or requesting services.
Such services may be in relation to the *development* of Sponge plugins or other assistance as may be required by
Sponge server owners. The advertised services **may** be in exchange for payment. Examples of services that may be
advertised in this section are:

* Developers seeking commissioned work, such as plugin development services or server management

* Server owners seeking the development of a plugin

* Server owners seeking assistance with the management of their server

Services that may **not** be advertised:

* Work not related to Minecraft servers

* The sale of existing plugins (or so-called "premium plugins")

* Any work that would break the Minecraft EULA or our Terms of Service

Developers seeking commissions must post in the Devs Available category, with or without rates, within the
“Devs Available” Category. These posts must follow the
`Devs Available Template and Rules <https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/devs-available-template-guidelines/15532>`__.

Users advertising a job they need fulfilling must post in the "Service Exchange" Category, with or without a bounty,
within the “Service Exchange” Category.  These posts must follow the
`Service Exchange Template and Rules <https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/service-exchange-template-guidelines/15531>`__.

Services may not be advertised or requested on any Sponge system outside of the **Services Exchange** forums section.

Preliminary discussion by interested parties asking for clarification of the advertisement may be publically discussed
on the thread, however any transaction relating to these advertisments, including a simple agreement to undertake the work,
must be doing privately and not on the advertisement thread. Any posts that do not strictly to these rules will be taken down.
